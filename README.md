# Product Starter Template
*The Foundation for High-Velocity, Secure Web Applications.*

This repository serves as the **Golden Template** for all new products in our organization. It comes pre-loaded with our standard operating procedures, CI/CD configurations, and AI collaboration directives.

> **💡 Philosophy: Self-Annealing**
> This repository is design to be **Antifragile**. Every AI agent and Human Engineer is expected to improve the processes (`docs/`) and code structure with every interaction. If you find a better way, update the Standard Operating Procedure.

## 🚀 How to Start a New Product using this Template

1.  **Clone/Use Template:**
    *   Click "Use this template" (if on GitHub) or copy this directory to `new-product-name`.
2.  **Initialize:**
    *   Run `npm create next-app .` (if building a Next.js app) or your preferred framework init command.
    *   Ensure you do *not* overwrite the `docs/` or `.github/` folders.
3.  **Read the Directives:**
    *   Open `docs/SOP_00_AI_DIRECTIVES.md`. This tells you (and your AI pair programmer) how to work.
